    <h2 class="h2">What's That?</h2>
        <p class="p">
        Calisthenics is a bodyweight training discipline focused on strength, control, and mobility.
        It is based on functional movements such as pull-ups, push-ups, levers, and handstands.
        This training method develops muscle, coordination, and balance in a complete way.
        It is suitable for all levels, from beginners to advanced athletes, thanks to scalable progressions.
        Calisthenics also enhances body awareness and mental discipline.

    <h2 class="h2 h2--reverse">What's So Special?</h2>
    <p class="p p--reverse">
        Calisthenics derives from the Greek words kallos (κάλλος), meaning “beauty,” and sthenos (σθένος), meaning
         “strength.” It develops a well-defined or fairly muscular body, a characteristic common in sports such as bodybuilding,
          but what truly makes it special is that it allows you to maintain elasticity, mobility, and full control of your body.
           Another unique aspect is that it can be practiced anywhere, and by “anywhere” we truly mean ANYWHERE: from purpose-built
            parks to your own home. Literally, to become a professional in this sport, you only need 2 m³ of space.

    <h2>Why I Choose this Sport?</h2>
    <p >Well, ever since I was a child, I was different from the others. All the boys I knew liked soccer, but honestly, I never found
         anything special in it, so I thought I was the one who was different. That’s where I was wrong. The truth is that the world always
          needs something new; it’s like a normal person who, after seeing the same things over and over, starts to get bored and looks for 
          something more original. When I saw the performances in this sport, the movements and the professional level, I thought, if they made
           it, why couldn’t I? From that moment, a flame was lit inside me, one that always wants more from this sport.
